# SystemProgramming-2022-2

Homeworks of **System Programming (430.658)** lecture, at 2022 Autumn.

Almost same as **lab assignments of CSAPP**.

## HW1: [bomblab](https://github.com/ckswjd99-at-snu/SystemProgramming-2022-2/tree/main/01bomblab)

The bomb is comprised of 7 phases and a secret phase. Using debbugger and disassembler, you have to find the correct answers for each phase and diffuse the bomb.

## HW2: [buflab](https://github.com/ckswjd99-at-snu/SystemProgramming-2022-2/tree/main/02buflab)

The bomb reads a string from standard input. Causing buffer overflow, you have to trigger some functions.

## HW3: [malloclab](https://github.com/ckswjd99-at-snu/SystemProgramming-2022-2/tree/main/03malloclab)

Implement own version of `malloc` and `free` using system calls managing heap memory. It have to work correctly and efficiently.

## HW4: [tshlab](https://github.com/ckswjd99-at-snu/SystemProgramming-2022-2/tree/main/04tshlab)

Write a simple Unix shell program that supports job control. You will become familiar with the concept of process control and signalling.

## HW5: [dbglab](https://github.com/ckswjd99-at-snu/SystemProgramming-2022-2/tree/main/05dbglab)

Using `ptrace` system call, develop your own debugger - SNU Debugger.

## HW6: [proxylab](https://github.com/ckswjd99-at-snu/SystemProgramming-2022-2/tree/main/06proxylab)

Write a simple HTTP proxy that caches web objects. It should work correctly, while dealing with multiple concurrent requests and caching web objects.
